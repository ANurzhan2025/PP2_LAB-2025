#1
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

#2 In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:

x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

#3 You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:

x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

#4
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

#5 error
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)

#6 The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
